About the Project

-  The Turkey National Genome and Bioinformatics Project, spearheaded by TÃœSEB (the Presidency of the Institutes of Health of Turkey), is a landmark initiative aimed at elucidating the molecular underpinnings of diseases, advancing diagnostics and therapeutic interventions, and laying the groundwork for personalized medicine. Leveraging Whole Genome, Whole Transcriptome, and metagenome sequencing, the project seeks to map the genetic diversity within the Turkish population and compare it with global datasets to enhance our understanding of genetic factors in disease.


Data Acquisition Challenges
-  While embarking on this ambitious journey, we encountered a critical challenge: discrepancies between the data reported on the website and our findings. This issue stems from inaccuracies in the website's presentation rather than in our data processing methodologies.

Gene Information Extraction
-  Tool Used: BeautifulSoup
-  Objective: Gather gene data across chromosomes, impacted by website inaccuracies but corrected through validation.

Transcript Information Collection
-  Tool Used: Selenium
-  Objective: Compile transcript data, with special attention to verification due to initial website misreporting.

Variant Information Compilation
-  Tool Used: Playwright
-  Objective: Catalog comprehensive variant data, underpinning the importance of cross-checking against reliable sources.

Future Directions
-  Understanding and rectifying the data presentation issues on the website are ongoing. We are committed to transparency and accuracy as we advance towards making significant contributions to genomics and personalized medicine.
